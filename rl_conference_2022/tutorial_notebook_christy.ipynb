    "“Recommender systems, offline RL, and more with Ray RLlib” is a hands-on tutorial for industry researchers, domain-experts, and ML-engineers, showcasing how ..\n",
    "\n",
    "1) .. you can use RLlib to build a recommender system for your industry application\n",
    "\n",
    "2) .. offline RL poses a solution in case you don't have a simulator of your problem environment at hand\n",
    "\n",
    "We will further explore how to deploy one or more trained models to production using Ray Serve and how to use RLlib's bandit algorithms to select a best model from some set of candidates for that purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the live-coding phases, we will build a recommender system simulating environment with RLlib, chose and configure an RLlib algorithm, and experiment and tune hyperparameters with Ray Tune.\n",
    "\n",
    "RLlib offers high scalability, a large list of algos to choose from (offline, model-based, model-free, etc..), support for TensorFlow and PyTorch, and a unified API for a variety of applications. This tutorial includes a brief introduction to provide an overview of concepts (e.g. why RL) before proceeding to RLlib (recommender system) environments, neural network models, offline RL, student exercises, Q/A, and more. All code will be provided as .py files in a GitHub repo."

    "(represented by integers). For example, in our game, where each agent can only go up/down/left/right, the action space would be `Discrete(4)`\n",
    "(no datatype, no shape needs to be defined here). Our observation space will be `MultiDiscrete([n, m])`, where n is the position of the agent observing and m is the position of the opposing agent, so if agent1 starts in the upper left corner and agent2 starts in the bottom right corner, agent1's observation would be: `[0, 63]` (in an 8 x 8 grid) and agent2's observation would be `[63, 0]`."

    "Scaling RLlib works by parallelizing the \"jobs\" that the remote `RolloutWorkers` do. In a vanilla RL algorithm, like PPO, DQN, and many others, the `@ray.remote` labeled RolloutWorkers in the figure above are responsible for interacting with one or more environments and thereby collecting experiences. Observations are produced by the environment, actions are then computed by the Policy(ies) copy located on the remote worker and sent to the environment in order to produce yet another observation. This cycle is repeated endlessly and only sometimes interrupted to send experience batches (\"train batches\") of a certain size to the \"local worker\". There these batches are used to call `Policy.learn_on_batch()`, which performs a loss calculation, followed by a model weights update, and a subsequent weights broadcast back to all the remote workers.\n",
