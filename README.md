# Hands-on RL with Ray’s RLlib

## Overview
“Hands-on RL with Ray’s RLlib” is a beginners tutorial for working with reinforcement learning (RL) environments, models, and algorithms using Ray’s RLlib library. It offers high scalability, a large list of algos to choose from (offline, model-based, model-free, etc..), support for TensorFlow and PyTorch, and a unified API for a variety of applications. This tutorial includes a brief introduction to provide an overview of concepts (e.g. why RL) before proceeding to RLlib models, hyperparameter tuning, debugging, student exercises, Q/A, and more. All code will be provided as .py files in a GitHub repo. 

## Intended Audience
* Python programmers who want to get started with reinforcement learning and RLlib

## Prerequisites
* Some Python programming experience
* Some familiarity with machine learning
* Experience in reinforcement learning and Ray would be helpful, but isn’t required
* Experience with TensorFlow or PyTorch would be helpful, but isn’t required

## Key Takeaways
* What is reinforcement learning and why RLlib
* How to configure and hyperparameter tune RLlib
* RLlib debugging best practices
