    "### Overview\n",
    "“Hands-on RL with Ray’s RLlib” is a beginners tutorial for working with reinforcement learning (RL) environments, models, and algorithms using Ray’s RLlib library. RLlib offers high scalability, a large list of algos to choose from (offline, model-based, model-free, etc..), support for TensorFlow and PyTorch, and a unified API for a variety of applications. This tutorial includes a brief introduction to provide an overview of concepts (e.g. why RL) before proceeding to RLlib (multi- and single-agent) environments, neural network models, hyperparameter tuning, debugging, student exercises, Q/A, and more. All code will be provided as .py files in a GitHub repo.\n",

    "### A word or two on Spaces:\n",
    "\n",
    "Spaces are used in ML to describe what possible/valid values inputs and outputs of a neural network can have.\n",
    "\n",
    "RL environments also use them to describe what their valid observations and actions are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spaces are usually defined by their shape (e.g. 84x84x3 RGB images) and datatype (e.g. uint8 for RGB values between 0 and 255).\n",
    "However, spaces could also be composed of other spaces (see Tuple or Dict spaces) or could be simply discrete with n fixed possible values\n",
    "(represented by integers). For example, in our game, where each agent can only go up/down/left/right, the action space would be `Discrete(4)`\n",
    "(no datatype, no shape needs to be defined here). Our observation space will be `MultiDiscrete([n, m])`, where n is the position of the agent observing and m is the position of the opposing agent, so if agent1 starts in the upper left corner and agent2 starts in the bottom right corner, agent1's observation would be: `[0, 63]` (in an 8 x 8 grid) and agent2's observation would be `[63, 0]`."

    "Scaling RLlib works by parallelizing the \"jobs\" that the remote `RolloutWorkers` do. In a vanilla RL algorithm, like PPO, DQN, and many others, the `@ray.remote` labeled RolloutWorkers in the figure above are responsible for interacting with one or more environments and thereby collecting experiences. Observations are produced by the environment, actions are then computed by the Policy(ies) copy located on the remote worker and sent to the environment in order to produce yet another observation. This cycle is repeated endlessly and only sometimes interrupted to send experience batches (\"train batches\") of a certain size to the \"local worker\". There these batches are used to call `Policy.learn_on_batch()`, which performs a loss calculation, followed by a model weights update, and a subsequent weights broadcast back to all the remote workers.\n",
